        This document describes a mechanism for updating the transport
        parameters of real-time communication sessions (e.g. as a result of
        mid-session device mobility) without disrupting ongoing communication
        and without requiring Offer/Answer negotiation.

      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> defines a way of discovering and validating a
        path between two peers. Switching an ongoing media session to an
        alternative path is therefore only possible after an ICE restart that
        would again produce a single "nominated" candidate pair for use by the
        applications.
      </t>
      <t>
        As a result, implementing path optimizations is currently a cumbersome
        process that is often implemented in a disruptive way or not supported
        at all.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document discusses ways of simplifying the process.  Special
        attention is being paid to preserving existing features in ICE and
        trickle ICE <xref target="I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> that allow
        implementations today to promptly release unused candidates or
        detect failures in a deterministic way.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Multipath ICE' anchor="section-mpice">
      <t>
        An ongoing discussion in MMUSIC <xref target="ICE-OPTS"/> is already
        investigating the possibility of having ICE processing yield multiple
        usable candidate pairs. A rough proposal for achieving this is being
        currently fleshed out <xref target="MPICE"/> and an IETF submission
        would likely follow shortly.
      </t>
      <t>
        Having ICE produce multiple usable candidate pairs opens up
        possibilities for various application specific adjustments and
        optimizations. Using multiple routes concurrently
        <xref target="I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp"/>  is one such example. Being
        able to swiftly switch between existing routes based on RTT or
        local indicators (e.g., perceived Wi-Fi signal strength) is another.
        Rapid route switching can also be used to support network mobility as
        described in <xref target="I-D.draft-wing-mmusic-ice-mobility"/>.
        (PENDING: use with MICE requires some further thought in order to
        optimize the case of a mobile peer talking to a public media server).
      </t>
      <t>
        Being able to update the list of available routes however, is a separate
        problem that is best handled by reusing of ICE restarts, trickle ICE and
        slightly improved signalling <xref target="trickle-restart"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Triggering a Trickle ICE Restart' anchor="trickle-restart">
      <t>
        The vanilla ICE specifications <xref target="RFC5245"/> defines ICE
        restarts as a non disruptive process where media can continue flowing
        between existing candidates while ICE is being re-run to discover new
        paths. ICE restarts can be triggered by either party and are signalled
        with the generation of new ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes by the party
        who is triggering the restart.
      </t>
      <t>
        An ICE restart may result in a set of valid candidate pairs that
        contains none, some, or all of the candidate pairs being used prior to
        the restart. The new candidate pair set may obviously also contain zero
        or more new valid pairs that were not available prior to the restart.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is entirely possible for an ICE restart to complete without
        triggering even a single change to current media flows. This is
        important because it gives implementors the possibility to use ICE
        restart as an incremental process that does not in any way disrupt
        existing paths.
      </t>
      <section title="Trickle-triggering an ICE restart">
        <t>
          Vanilla ICE defines trigger for an ICE restart as a change in the
          ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes. While this constitutes a trivial
          change, standard Offer/Answer semantics imply the generation of a
          complete offer and answer even if the above to attributes are so far
          the only change in the session.
        </t>
        <t>
          To avoid such a heavy process, this document suggests using trickle
          ICE semantics for the delivery of the two attributes. This way,
          whenever an ICE implementation stack issues the new values for the
          ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes, the using application will deliver
          them the same way it usually delivers trickled candidates.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
          <xref target="RFC3261"/> this would imply sending an SIP INFO request
          <xref target="I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip"/> that could look like
          the following:

      <section title="Operation">
        <t>
          Once a restart is triggered, ICE processing will mostly continue
          similarly to the way it does with initial session establishment.
          Pairs and checklists will be recreated as per regular trickle ICE
          procedures.
        </t>
        <section title="Re-checking currently valid pairs">
          <t>
            Depending on the event that triggered the ICE restart, some of the
            newly formed pairs will likely be identical to those currently
            in-use by the agents. This would be the case, for example, in
            situations where a new interface has become available. While it is
            very likely for these pairs to continue working the same way as
            before the restart, it is RECOMMENDED that they be subject to a new
            set of connectivity checks in case the change in network
            configuration has further impact than the usually expected.
          </t>
          <t>
            For example, a newly available network interface would normally only
            imply new connection possibilities. In some cases however, such as
            the launch of a VPN application, the new interface might have been
            accompanied by a change of routing policies that have invalidated
            the earlier available routes.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Relationshiop with Multipath ICE">
          <t>
            An ICE restart would typically result in a set of valid pairs. In
            cases where Multipath ICE is being used, agents MUST make sure that,
            as long as they are still valid, all paths that were in use prior to
            the restart, would still be usable after it completes.
          </t>
          <t>
            The exact semantics for selecting and enabling one or multiple such
            paths simultaneously are still being discussed and worked out in
            <xref target="MPICE"/>. Still, regardless of the specific messaging
            to take place, it is important that ICE implementations can and
            should behave in a way that does not, even briefly, disrupt media
            flow on pairs that are still valid.

    <section title='The case against infinite trickling' anchor="end-of-ice">
      <t>
        As part of the ongoing discussions on improving ICE, it has been
        suggested <xref target="MPICE"/> that candidate updates be handled by
        making candidate trickling an endless process.
      </t>
      <t>
        While endless trickling does provide a simple solution to some common
        use cases, it also introduces some significant drawbacks:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbol">
          <t>
            Clearly determining failure. In the vast majority of cases, ICE
            agents would likely have a very finite set of candidates. Trickling
            and checking these candidates is currently a very clearly delimited
            process that makes it possible to detect failure and alert users in
            a timely manner. Using endless trickling would make that impossible
            and would require the introduction of "magic" timers.
          </t>
          <t>
            Promptly releasing and reallocating unnecessary candidates.
            Currently, the finite nature of ICE processing makes it trivial for
            agents to decide when they need to release, stop maintaining, or
            reallocate resources such as relay or server-reflexive candidates.
            Losing the clear boundaries of ICE processing would remove that
            ability and, once again, require the introduction of arbitrary times
            in order to avoid wasting resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            Endless trickling has been known to hang out with Ronan, the Green
            Goblin and various zombies. It also regularly contributes to
            global warming.
